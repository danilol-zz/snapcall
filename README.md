# SnapCall

Danilo's ELM test for Snapview ELM developer position.

The solution I'm providing connects to the json-server mocked API, for getting configuration and posting commands.

# How to run
In order to start the project, first install the dependencies using:
`yarn install`

then run the start command:
`yarn start`

This will start the app on `http://localhost:8080` and the json-server on `http://localhost:3000`
This will be our mock API. We use two resources: `/config` and `acknowledgments`

When you access the app address, you should see the HomePage:
